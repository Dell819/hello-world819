Beginning the journey.

I'm learning to code because I'm eager to escape the lack opportunity and the time-sucking chains of traditional employment in environments that are not conducive to a growth mindset.

I want:

Fulfilling employment.

MAKE MORE MONEY
--to get a house
--to take care of family
--to have fewer financial worries

to find that thing in life that I'm good at and join others doing and enjoying that (code) thing.

Create awesome things and stuff!!
